// exercise 12-1. 
// 1. Create a class called Integer that has a single, 
// private member variable of type int. 
// 2. P/ provide a class constructthat outputs a message when an object is created. 
// 3. Define member functions to get and set the member variable and to output its value. 
// 4. Write a test program to create and manipulate at least three Integer objects and 
// verify that you canâ€™t assign a value directly to the member variable.
// 
// 5. Exercise all the class member functions by getting, setting, and 
// outputting the value of the member variable of each object. 
// 6. Make sure to create at least one const Integer object and 
// verify which operations you can and cannot apply on it.
